# Handwritten Character Recognition
Simple MNIST trained handwriting recognition model using CNN with webpage playground

Run **main.py** to train model which is then checkpointed

Run **test.py** to see example predictions on randomly drawn digits on trained model (set version to match the version you want to load).

Run **flask --app server run** in the web directory to launch an interactive website that allows to draw a digit that gets predicted by the model (set version to match the version you want to load).
